# Welcome!

OpenSavvy is a group of developers who create tools _we are proud of_.

OpenSavvy has multiple core values:

- **Open Source** — Code that cannot be read, cannot be trustworthy
- **Free** — Running our projects on your own hardware is free
- **Security** — Users retain full control over their data, with full transparency over security threats
- **Quality** — A tool that doesn't work is of use to no one
- **Automation** — The only way to move fast without sacrificing any of the above is to automate _everything_

## Our method

When we need something that doesn't exist—**we create it**. Over time, we create a cohesive ecosystem of libraries, scripts and tools, meant to interoperate, while staying usable in isolation.
