# CI Containers

The most convenient to run a CI pipeline in a reproducible environment is to use containers. Containers are lightweight snapshots of a system, including all its libraries and dependencies.

We regularly build and update containers for the various technologies we build projects for, including our [Kotlin supported platforms](../libraries/supported-platforms.md).
