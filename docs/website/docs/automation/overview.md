# Overview

At OpenSavvy, we believe that the only way to achieve our goals of quality without losing on efficiency is to automate everything that can be automated. We also deploy a large fleet of libraries, whose configuration must remain in sync.

Most of our automation projects therefore focus on continuous testing, integration and deployment.
