# Gradle Conventions

We deploy a large amount of Gradle-based projects, especially library. These libraries need to be built similarly, so we can update them quickly without having to re-learn their specificities.

Our Gradle Conventions are a collection of Gradle plugins that encapsulate all the functionality we may need. These are tailored very specifically to our needs, so they are unlikely to fit your ownâ€”however, you may always use them as inspiration or to learn more about what is possible.
