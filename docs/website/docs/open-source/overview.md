# Overview

Open Source is a statement for the future: we believe in the ecosystem, and we believe that anyone should continue our projects, should we give them up. 

In this section, we showcase our vision, and teach you how to contribute to the Open Source ecosystem yourself.

## Contributing to open source projects

Many people are interested to contributing to the open source ecosystem, but do not know where to start: what are forks, merge requests, what happens during a review? We wrote a guide to contribution:

1. [**What are forks, and why do we use them?**](contributing/1-forks.md)
2. [**How do I submit changes?**](contributing/2-changes.md)
3. [**What goes on during code review?**](contributing/3-review.md)

Each project is different, and each maintainer expects different things.
Project-specific instructions are often described in a file named `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
These articles describe the most common practices as well as our own conventions.

## Guides and tutorials

This section explains how to perform specific actions to configure your own environment.
These articles are not necessary in the general case, but we found that they are a common source of difficulty for our contributors.
