# The Playgrounds

The Playgrounds are project templates for various technologies that are able to automatically update themselves, and contain everything necessary to develop, document and automatically test a project.

To learn more, [visit them](https://gitlab.com/opensavvy/playgrounds).

## Baseline

The Baseline Playground is a stack-agnostic project template. It contains a CI pipeline that generates a documentation website following OpenSavvy's conventions, IntelliJ settings for coding style, [DevContainer](https://containers.dev/) and [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) support, a contributing guide, etc.

## Gradle

The Gradle Playground builds upon the Baseline Playground, adding Gradle and Kotlin Multiplatform support, including the CI required to build all of [our supported platforms](../libraries/supported-platforms.md) and publish them to the GitLab Registry and to MavenCentral.
