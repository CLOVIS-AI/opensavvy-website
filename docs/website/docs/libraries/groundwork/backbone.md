# Backbone

Backbone is an opinionated software architecture pattern to create fullstack applications that share code between client and servers, as well as applications that have heterogeneous data sources (e.g. multiple database or cloud data sources).

Backbone aggressively uses [caching](pedestal-cache.md) to avoid unnecessary work and to represent data as immutable but observable references that can be directly consumed by reactive frameworks (e.g. Compose).
