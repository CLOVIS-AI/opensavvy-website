# Vite for Kotlin (Beta)

By default, Kotlin uses Webpack when transpiling to JavaScript. Webpack is quite old, consumes a lot of RAM, and can be quite slow to automatically-reload projects.

Vite is one of the most popular bundlers in the JavaScript ecosystem, known for its blazingly fast reload times during development.
We have created a Gradle plugin allowing to use Vite in Kotlin/JS projects.
