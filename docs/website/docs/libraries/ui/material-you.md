# Material You (Experimental)

Material You is the algorithm powering Android's Material3 dynamic color theme: the user can select a few main colors, and the algorithm generates an entire palette for all components of an application.

Google releases implementations for [multiple languages](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities), but not for Kotlin Multiplatform. We port the Java implementation to Kotlin, ensuring all platforms are supported.
